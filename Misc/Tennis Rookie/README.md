# Tennis Rookie

```
I can never figure out which hand to hold my racket in
```

connection info: `nc nc.lagncra.sh 8008` \

This gives us a Racket shell.

If it wasn't obvious here, I didn't know what I was doing. I have 0 experience with the Racket Programming language. \
Howver, not all is lost. I asked chatGPT to generate some code to list files, and got this
```
> (require file)

(define files (directory-list "."))

(for-each displayln files)
> > .dockerenv
bin
boot
dev
etc
flag
home
key
lib
lib32
lib64
libx32
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
srv
sys
tmp
usr
var
```
There are some interesting files here. Most notably `flag` and `key`. \
```
> (define file (open-input-file "flag"))

(let loop ((line (read-line file)))
  (cond
    ((eof-object? line)
     (close-input-port file))
    (else
     (displayln line)
     (loop (read-line file)))))>

```
This looks quite similar to the flag, but it seems to have been encrypted in some cipher.
```
> (define file (open-input-file "key"))

(let loop ((line (read-line file)))
  (cond
    ((eof-object? line)
     (close-input-port file))
    (else
     (displayln line)
     (loop (read-line file)))))>

This is actually encryped using the [Vigen√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher). A cipher that utilizes a key in it's encryption scheme
